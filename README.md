# PhonebookApp
This is the final project for a second semester Java class I took in college. 

# Motivation
As I was learning more OOP concepts throughout the semseter, I had to build this PhonebookApp little by little using the concepts learned in class.

# Usage
This program can be run with or without using a command line argument. If the user chooses not use a command line argument, the program should be executed like you would execute any program. If the user chooses to use a command line argument, the user should traverse to the directory where the java file is located, and run the program and write the file name: "java PhonebookApp fileName". The file used should be in the following format: last name, first name, how many phone numbers each person has, type of number (description), and the phone number. 

# Build Status
This program is considered complete. I do not plan to update or add to it in the future.
